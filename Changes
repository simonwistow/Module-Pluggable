       $self->search_path( add => 'Some::Path'      );
       $self->search_path( new => 'Some::New::Path' );


2005-02-02 - 2.6 Problems under tests 

    Richard Clamp diagnosed a problem as being due to the 
    fact that we exclude anything not from blib if there 
    was blib.pm is %INC. Of course if the module being 
    tested used another module that used Module::Pluggable 
    then the second module would fail. 

    Fixed it by checking to see if the caller had (^|/)blib/
    in their filename.

2004-12-20 - 2.5 'Inspiration' from Module::Pluggable::Fast
   
    Noticed Sebastian Riedel's curious Module::Pluggable::Fast
    which appears to break API backwards compatability in order
    to inline an explicit call to 'new'. It has no tests.

    A quick benchmark showed that it was about 10% faster 
    because of cruft that had accumulated over time. So
    a few quick changes and now Module::Pluggable is only 
    3% slower. Which is nice. 

    Also added a patch from Barbie to fix things under Windows.

2004-12-15 - 2.4 Bug fix

    There seemed to be some irregularities in how 5.8.1 worked 
    with the list_packages method. Fixed thanks to Schwern, 
    Michael Cummings and Jos Boumans. 

    Added some more documentation.

    Added ability to specify except and only as regexes.

2004-10-27 - 2.3 Niceties

    Allow you to explicitly stop looking for inner packages.
    Made it nicer to have single element search_dirs and search_paths.
    

2004-10-08 - 2.2 Dieting
    
    Thanks to suggestion and patches from Adam Kennedy 
    Module::Pluggable has dumped some weight and got rid of 
    the none Core dependecies of File::Find::Rule and 
    UNIVERSAL::require


2004-08-25 - 2.1 Small buglette

    Require inner packages when appropriate. This helps towards
    making things work with PAR. Thanks to Brian Cassidy.

    Never released.
    
2004-08-19 - 2.0 Working inner packages

    As long as you have require or instantiate set then we'll also find
    inner packages. Why I didn't fix this way back in 1.3 I don't know.

2004-07-18 - 1.9 Add 'package' option

    This lets you install a method in another package's 
    namespace. Thanks to Simon Cozens.

2004-07-08 - 1.8 Fix those two options

    They worked before but now they're more robust.

2004-07-07 - 1.7 Add support for limiting plugins

    Added 'only' and ''except' options.

2004-06-03 - 1.6 Add a traditional Makefile.PL
    
    Even though I think Module::Build is much better.

2004-05-25 - 1.5 Build.PL stupidity

    Must add prereqs. Doh.

2004-05-25 - 1.4  Multiple instances

    Made it so you could use it twice in the same package.
    Removed the inner package stuff inorder to fix it properly.

2004-05-06 - 1.3  Ability to search in inner packages 

    Simon Cozens donated some code to allow us to search 
    inner packages.

2004-05-06 - 1.2  Fix minor buglet
    
    Apply a patch from Tom Insam to fix requiring without
    instantiating and make require failures more verbose.

2003-12-15 - 1.11 Update MANIFEST.
    
    So that make dist works properly.

2003-12-15 - 1.1  Make it work with multi level plugins

    Apparently Foo::Plugin::Bar::Quux doesn't work. 
    Thanks to Darren Chamberlain for spotting this.

2003-12-15 - 1.00 Add some more features
    
    Added the ability to require without instantiating (for Tom Insam)    
    Prevented the names from being explicitly sorted (again, for Tom Insam)
    Added in the ability to provide other search directorys.

2003-11-27 - 0.95 Some Test::More issues

    Explicitly number the tests which fixes some test more failures


2003-10-21 - 0.9  We can rebuild you, we have the technology
    
    Having used this in the wild some changes to make it better.


2003-10-20 - 0.8  Fix.
    
    Namespace issues.


2003-10-17 - 0.7  And take your Build.PL with you

    Pesky MANIFEST.SKIP


2003-10-15 - 0.6  Initial release

    Be free my pretty. EMANCIPIA!
